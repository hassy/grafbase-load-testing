# Load testing Grafbase with Artillery

Grafbase is a unified data layer platform, that lets you combine your data sources into a centralized GraphQL endpoint. Grafbase manages all the infrastructure for you to let you focus on shipping products instead of building infrastructure.

This repo contains example scripts to show how a Grafbase deployment can be load tested with Artillery.

The application under test is the [example BaseNews application](https://grafbase.com/docs/quickstart/get-started).
